Milestones:

- Text analysis program purpose:
    - Keyword extraction.

- Text analysis method:
    - Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras can be used for these kinds of analyses.
    Note:(I think it would be healthier to use Keras library.)
    We can use Keras library
- Model training:
    - 

- Evaluate mode: 
    - Using a test dataset to assess the performance of model. Measure metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. 

- Data collection method: 
    - Twitch:
        - Live streaming API to obtain text.
    - Youtube:


- Text preprocessing program:
    - NLTK, SpaCy, or TextBlob.

- Process and store the data:
    - After obtaining the live streaming chat data, we can store that in MongoDB.

- Application or service integration.
